A program to implement k-medoids algorithm from scratch. The program calculates the dissimilarity matrix and then apply the k-medoids algorithm. The clustering process continues until cluster assignments do not change or maximum 100 iterations have
been completed. The program also calculates average silhouette width for the final clustering solution.
